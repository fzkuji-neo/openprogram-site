# Agent calls and ordinary methods

Use `agent()` for a direct model request. Use an `Agent` subclass when several methods share model settings and instructions. The framework creates call scopes and Context automatically.

## Ordinary methods

```python
from openprogram import Agent

class ReviewAgent(Agent):
    tools = []
    instructions = "Preserve facts. Return concise text."

    def classify(self, review: str) -> str:
        """Classify review sentiment."""
        return self(f"Classify as positive, negative, or neutral:\n{review}")

    def summarize(self, review: str) -> str:
        """Summarize a review with its sentiment."""
        sentiment = self.classify(review)
        return self(f"Summarize this {sentiment} review in one sentence:\n{review}")

reviewer = ReviewAgent(model="configured-model")
summary = reviewer.summarize("The service was fast.")
```

`classify` and `summarize` are ordinary Python methods. Their scopes retain the parent relationship. `self(...)` makes a model request through the existing Runtime. The docstring describes the function call. The prompt provides the model instruction and data.

An Agent instance stores configuration. It does not implicitly retain a conversation between independent top-level calls. Nested calls use the active execution. Context selects permitted history and resolves configured content for each request.

## Direct calls and asynchronous code

```python
from openprogram import agent, agent_async

answer = agent("Summarize this text", tools=[])
# In an async function:
# answer = await agent_async("Summarize this text", tools=[])
# answer = await reviewer.arun("Summarize this text")
```

Use `tools=[]` for a request without model tools. With `tools=None`, the runtime resolves available tools and applies the current authorization rules.

## Method metadata and explicit tools

Declare `method_options` when a public method needs input form metadata, visibility rules, or explicit tool registration:

```python
class TextAgent(Agent):
    tools = []
    method_options = {
        "summarize": {
            "tool": True,
            "name": "summarize_text",
            "input": {"text": {"description": "Text to summarize"}},
            "expose": "io",
        },
    }

    def summarize(self, text: str) -> str:
        """Summarize text."""
        return self(f"Summarize:\n{text}")
```

Recording a method does not make it a tool. `tool=True` explicitly registers the method. Function names and signatures supply the tool schema. Visibility controls history rendering and does not grant tool permissions.

## Ordinary Program functions

The managed loader captures ordinary source-defined functions in authorized Program packages. List public entry functions in `PROGRAM_ENTRIES`. Private helpers retain call scopes without becoming tools. This capture does not extend to arbitrary host files or dependencies.

For deterministic composition, call methods or functions in Python. For model-selected calls, supply explicitly registered tools. See [tool calling](../choosing-the-next-step/tool-calling.md).

## Method behavior

Agent methods retain explicit metadata, tool registration, authorization, and durable steps through `method_options`. The [API reference](../../../reference/api/agent.md) documents Context, method options, and method configuration. Existing [function metadata](function-metadata.md) describes the method fields.
