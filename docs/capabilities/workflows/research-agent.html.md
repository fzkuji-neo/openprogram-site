# Research Agent

An autonomous research agent: take a research topic and walk the full pipeline of literature survey → idea generation → experiments → writing → review → rebuttal / presentation, producing a submission-ready paper. It does not trust its own output — every citation is verified against four indexes (Crossref / OpenAlex / Semantic Scholar / arXiv), every number in the paper must trace back to an experiment's `run_record.json`, and the review can run on a different model (author and reviewer use different models to avoid self-grading).

## Availability

Every supported release contains the Research and Wiki Programs together with PyMuPDF for PDF parsing. No Program or PDF dependency installation is required after installing OpenProgram. Developers can replace either Program with an editable checkout.

## Usage

The entry function is **`research_agent`**, registered as a tool (`as_tool=True`, toolset `research`). In chat, just describe a research task to trigger it, e.g. "Survey recent work on LLM uncertainty".

Run it directly from the command line:

```bash
openprogram programs run research_agent -a task="Survey recent work on LLM uncertainty"
```

Internally it is a two-level controller. At the first level, the LLM chooses which research stage to enter (literature / idea / experiment / writing / review / rebuttal / presentation / theory / knowledge / project; stages have dependency ordering, and missing prerequisites are filled in first). At the second level, within a stage, the LLM picks and runs that stage's functions one by one. About 89 functions across 10 stages; each function is an ordinary Python file whose docstring is the prompt, directly editable.

Hidden entry parameters (available to code / CLI callers):

| Parameter | Description |
|---|---|
| `review_runtime` | When provided, review functions run on a different model (cross-model review) |
| `work_dir` | Project working directory |
| `max_runtime_s` | Soft time budget: after the deadline no new work starts; running steps finish and wrap up normally |
| `stop_event` | Graceful stop signal (any object with `is_set()`); wraps up after the current step finishes |

The return value is a dict: `task`, `success`, `summary`, `stages_completed`, `history`.

## Dependency notes

- Citation verification, uncited-claim checks, citation-dump checks, and similar verifications are pure Python / regex — no extra tokens; `integrity_gate` uses a single bounded LLM call.
- Online retrieval (arXiv / Semantic Scholar, etc.) requires network access; LaTeX compilation requires a local TeX distribution.
