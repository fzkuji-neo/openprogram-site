# Runtime

> Source: [`openprogram/agentic_programming/runtime.py`](https://github.com/fzkuji-neo/OpenProgram/blob/main/openprogram/agentic_programming/runtime.py)

The LLM runtime. Wraps an LLM provider, automatically computes context from the session DAG, calls the LLM, and writes the reply back to the DAG.

---

## Class: `Runtime`

```python
class Runtime(call=None, model="default", max_retries=None, api_key=None, skills=None)
```

### Constructor parameters

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|------|------|--------|------|
| `call` | `Callable \| None` | `None` | A user-supplied LLM function. Signature: `fn(content: list[dict], model: str, response_format: dict) -> str`. Internally it is wrapped into the standard provider path via a `CallableModel`, so DAG recording and history rendering work the same as with a real provider. If neither `call` nor a `"provider:model_id"` model is given, subclass and override `_call()` |
| `model` | `str` | `"default"` | The default model. Two forms: `"provider:model_id"` (e.g. `"anthropic:claude-sonnet-4-6"`) resolves through `openprogram.providers` and streams via the provider layer; any other string is only meaningful together with `call=` or a subclass. Unknown `"provider:model_id"` values raise `ValueError` |
| `max_retries` | `int \| None` | `None` | Maximum number of exec() attempts (including the first call, and must be >= 1). `None` = read the environment variable `OPENPROGRAM_MAX_RETRIES`, defaulting to `6` if unset |
| `api_key` | `str \| None` | `None` | API key for the provider path. `None` = resolved from the credential store (`openprogram providers login`) |
| `skills` | `bool \| list[str] \| None` | `None` | Skill discovery for the system prompt. `None` / `False` = disabled; `True` = probe the default skill directories (user + repo); `list[str]` = explicit directory list. When enabled, an `<available_skills>` block is appended to the system prompt on every `exec()` |

### Attributes

| Attribute | Type | Description |
|------|------|------|
| `model` | `str` | The default model name |
| `max_retries` | `int` | The resolved retry budget |
| `system` | `str` | Assignable system prompt used by `exec()` on the provider path (the `method_options["method"]["system"]` sets it for the duration of a call) |
| `thinking_level` | `str` | Reasoning-effort knob: `"off"` (default) / `"low"` / `"medium"` / `"high"` / `"xhigh"`; passed through to the provider |
| `session_id` | `str` | Stable id across successive `exec()` calls (`"op-<hex>"`); providers use it as the prompt-cache key |
| `on_stream` | `Callable \| None` | Optional callback `fn(event_dict)` for streaming events (text / thinking / tool_use / tool_result) |
| `last_usage` | `dict \| None` | Token usage of the last call: `{input_tokens, output_tokens, total_tokens, cache_read, cache_create, ...}` |

---

## Methods

### `exec()`

```python
Runtime.exec(content, context=None, response_format=None, model=None,
             tools=None, toolset=None, tools_source=None, tools_allow=None,
             tools_deny=None, tool_choice="auto", parallel_tool_calls=True,
             max_iterations=20, choices=None, timeout_s=None, on_retry=None,
             web_search=False, stream_fn=None) -> Any
```

Calls the LLM, with context computed automatically from the session DAG.

**Inside an Agent method or managed function scope:**
1. Starting from the current function's DAG node, `render_context` uses `expose` / `render_range` to determine which historical nodes to read this time
2. `render_dag_messages` renders those nodes into messages
3. `_call()` is invoked to send the request
4. The reply is written into the `llm` node that `exec()` opened at the start of the call

**When called with no DAG store installed** (standalone scripts, no dispatcher): `content` is wrapped into a single user message and sent as a single-turn call; nothing is recorded.

An Agent method or function scope can call `exec()` multiple times; each call is a new `llm` node on the DAG.

#### Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|------|------|--------|------|
| `content` | `list[dict] \| str` | *(required)* | List of content blocks (see format below). A plain string is wrapped into one text block |
| `context` | `str \| None` | `None` | Legacy parameter, ignored — the provider path builds history from the DAG |
| `response_format` | `dict \| JsonSchemaOutput \| None` | `None` | A bare JSON Schema or normalized `JsonSchemaOutput` envelope. Verified provider/model combinations use their registered native mapping; otherwise `fallback="auto"` may use the verified hidden strict-tool path, while prompt fallback requires explicit `fallback="prompt"`. Unsupported or lossy combinations fail closed. The terminal value is parsed and validated locally against the original schema and returned as a Python JSON value. `max_validation_retries` is `0`, `1`, or `2` (default `2`); validation repair and truncated generation share this allowance. Also forwarded to `_call()` for subclasses |
| `model` | `str \| None` | `None` | Override the default model |
| `tools` | `list \| None` | `None` | The tools available to the LLM for this call. Entries may be explicitly registered Agent methods, `{"spec":..., "execute":...}` dicts, or objects with `.spec` / `.execute`. If set, the tool loop runs until the model returns plain text. **Default (`None`) is not "no tools"**: the call gets the full registered toolset; pass `toolset="none"` for a reasoning-only call, or `tools=[]` for an explicit empty list |
| `toolset` / `tools_source` / `tools_allow` / `tools_deny` | — | `None` | Toolset preset and policy filtering: `toolset` names a preset (`"full"` is the implicit default, `"none"` opts out), `tools_source` filters per channel source, `tools_allow` / `tools_deny` are name allow/deny lists |
| `tool_choice` | `str \| dict` | `"auto"` | `"auto"` / `"required"` / `"none"` / `{"type":"function","name":"X"}` to force a specific tool. Passed through to the provider (OpenAI / Anthropic / Gemini / Bedrock each map it to their own protocol form) |
| `parallel_tool_calls` | `bool` | `True` | Allow multiple tool calls in a single turn; `False` is passed through to providers that support the switch |
| `max_iterations` | `int` | `20` | Upper bound on tool-loop iterations (one iteration = one model call plus its tool execution). The effective value is `max(1, max_iterations)`. Chat turns pass no cap. This default of 20 only applies to `runtime.exec` |
| `choices` | `dict \| list \| None` | `None` | If set, constrains the **end** of the turn: after the model finishes the full turn, its final reply must pick one of `choices`; `exec` parses and returns the result of that choice. See [next-step-decision](../../capabilities/agentic-programming/choosing-the-next-step/next-step-decision.md) for details |
| `timeout_s` | `float \| None` | `None` | The wall-clock time budget for the entire `exec()` (including all retry sleeps); on timeout, raises `LLMError` (`reason=TIMEOUT`, `retryable=False`). `None` = fall back to the `OPENPROGRAM_EXEC_TIMEOUT_S` environment variable (unset or `0` = unbounded) |
| `on_retry` | `Callable \| None` | `None` | An observation callback invoked before each backoff sleep (once per failed attempt that has a retry queued), receiving a `RetryInfo`; not fired for the terminal failure. Exceptions raised inside the callback are swallowed |
| `web_search` | `bool` | `False` | Enable the provider's native web-search tool for this call, where supported |
| `stream_fn` | — | `None` | Per-call stream-function override (used by the dispatcher and tests to inject a fake or pre-built stream); `None` = the real provider |

#### Content block format

```python
{"type": "text",  "text": "Find the login button."}
{"type": "image", "path": "screenshot.png"}
{"type": "image", "data": "<base64>", "mime_type": "image/png"}
{"type": "video", "path": "clip.mp4"}
{"type": "audio", "path": "recording.wav"}
```

Media blocks take either a `path` (read and base64-encoded automatically, mime type guessed from the extension) or inline `data` + `mime_type`. A text block may carry `"role": "system"` to contribute to the system prompt, and text/image blocks accept `cache_control` for provider prompt caching. Unknown block types are skipped silently.

#### Return value

With `response_format=None`, returns the LLM reply as `str`. With a structured
`response_format`, returns the locally validated Python JSON value (`dict`,
`list`, scalar, or `None`). With `choices`, returns the parsed decision result
(the return value of the selected function, or the selected value itself).

#### Exceptions

- `RuntimeError` — the runtime is closed (`close()` was called)
- `TypeError` / `NotImplementedError` — raised immediately, never retried (programming errors: wrong call signature, no provider configured)
- `LLMError` — raised when retries are exhausted or a non-retryable error is hit; structured fields include `reason` / `retryable` / `http_status` / `retry_after_s` / `attempts` / `elapsed_s` / `provider` / `model`, etc.
- `StructuredOutputSchemaError` — invalid public schema or envelope; stable `code="invalid_schema"`.
- `StructuredOutputUnsupportedError` — no verified lossless provider/fallback contract; stable `code="unsupported"`.
- `StructuredOutputValidationError` — invalid JSON, schema mismatch, or hidden-submit contract failure; stable codes are `invalid_json`, `validation_failed`, `missing_submission`, and `mixed_submission`.
- `StructuredOutputGenerationError` — refusal or incomplete provider terminal; stable codes are `refusal` and `incomplete`.

All structured-output errors expose the stable `.code` and bounded `.issues`
fields. Provider candidate text is not part of the public diagnostic contract.

### `async_exec()`

```python
await Runtime.async_exec(content, context=None, response_format=None, model=None,
                         timeout_s=None, on_retry=None, tools=None, toolset=None,
                         max_iterations=None) -> Any
```

The async version of `exec()`. It has the same `response_format=None` text
return and structured Python JSON return/error contract. Internally it calls
`_async_call()`; a `call=` function may be synchronous or asynchronous, and the
default provider path uses the same AgentSession structured lifecycle. Same
`timeout_s` / `on_retry` semantics as `exec()`; retries sleep with
`asyncio.sleep`, so external cancellation works. It accepts the synchronous tool-loop options, including tools, toolset, max_iterations, and tool authorization filters.

---

### `_call()`

```python
Runtime._call(content, model="default", response_format=None) -> Any
```

The method that actually calls the LLM once (no retry — `exec()` wraps it in the retry loop). The default implementation routes through the provider layer (`AgentSession`) when a provider model or `call=` function is configured, and raises `NotImplementedError` otherwise. **Override this method when subclassing.**

#### Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|------|------|------|
| `content` | `list[dict]` | The current turn's content blocks (history is rendered from the DAG by the provider path) |
| `model` | `str` | The model name |
| `response_format` | `dict \| None` | Output format constraint |

#### Return value

Raw text for ordinary calls; the validated Python JSON value when a structured
format is active.

---

### `_async_call()`

```python
await Runtime._async_call(content, model="default", response_format=None) -> Any
```

The async version of `_call()`. Override this method when subclassing to support an async provider.

---

### `close()`

Releases resources and ends the session; after `close()`, `exec()` raises `RuntimeError`. `Runtime` is also a context manager (`with Runtime(...) as rt:` closes on exit). Subclasses override it to clean up provider-specific resources.

---

### Asking the user

When a front-end session is connected, a runtime can block on user input mid-function: `runtime.ask(prompt, options=..., multi=..., questions=[...], timeout=300.0, default=None)` (one question or several in one card), `runtime.confirm(prompt, default=False)` (yes/no), and `runtime.form(prompt, fields)` (multi-field form). `runtime.can_ask()` reports whether anyone is there to answer (False on headless runs). A declined question raises `UserDeclined`; a timeout returns `default` when given, else raises `AskTimeout`.

---

## Usage

Supply a host Runtime to Agent. Ordinary methods inherit it automatically. They require no decorator or manual Context management.

```python
from openprogram import Agent, Runtime


def my_llm(content, model="host-model", response_format=None):
    texts = [block["text"] for block in content if block["type"] == "text"]
    return call_my_api("\n".join(texts), model=model)

runtime = Runtime(call=my_llm, model="host-model")

class Observer(Agent):
    tools = []

    def observe(self, task: str):
        """Identify the requested screen element."""
        return self([
            {"type": "text", "text": f"Find: {task}"},
            {"type": "image", "path": "screenshot.png"},
        ])

observer = Observer(runtime=runtime)
try:
    answer = observer.observe("login button")
finally:
    runtime.close()
```

The [Agent and Context API](agent.md) defines configuration, explicit sessions, and scopes. Method configurations remain compatible.

## Retry mechanism

`exec()` and `async_exec()` have built-in automatic retries to handle transient LLM API errors (network timeouts, rate limits, server errors, etc.).

### Configuration

```python
# Default: max_retries=None → read env var OPENPROGRAM_MAX_RETRIES, defaulting to 6 if unset
rt = Runtime(call=my_llm)

# No retries (raise an exception on the first failure)
rt = Runtime(call=my_llm, max_retries=1)

# Multiple retries (for an unstable API)
rt = Runtime(call=my_llm, max_retries=5)
```

### Behavior rules

| Situation | Handling |
|------|------|
| API call succeeds | Return the result |
| API raises a transient exception | Record the failed attempt, sleep with exponential backoff (base 1.5 s x 2^attempt, +/-25% jitter; a server `Retry-After` hint is honored as a lower bound; base tunable via `OPENPROGRAM_RETRY_BACKOFF_BASE`), then retry until `max_retries` is reached |
| Permanent error (bad image data, expired auth, invalid API key, or the provider marked the exception `retryable=False`) | Raised immediately as `LLMError` with `retryable=False`, no retry |
| The provider already exhausted its own transport-retry budget (`transport_exhausted`) | Not re-retried — raised as `LLMError` |
| `TypeError` or `NotImplementedError` | Raised immediately, no retry (usually a problem with the provider implementation or the way it's called) |
| All retries fail | Raise a structured `LLMError` (fields such as `reason` / `retryable` / `http_status` / `attempts`), with a full attempt report attached |

### Error report format

When all retries are exhausted, the `LLMError` raised contains the error information for each attempt; its structured fields (`reason` / `retryable` / `http_status` / `attempts` / `elapsed_s`, etc.) can be read directly:

```
LLMError: exec() failed after 3 attempt(s):
Attempt 1: ConnectionError: timeout
Attempt 2: RateLimitError: 429 Too Many Requests
Attempt 3: ConnectionError: timeout
```

### The boundaries of retrying

Transient transport failures, structured-output repairs, and repetitive tool-enabled responses share the invocation's failure-recovery allowance. A repetitive response is discarded and regenerated in the same Agent context, preserving completed tool results and their Runtime receipts. This recovery does not impose an aggregate token or duration limit. Explicit caller limits, cancellation, permission failures, and exhausted recovery remain authoritative. Repeating a response is not permission to repeat an external write; an uncertain write outcome requires inspection before another attempt. Function logic errors still require a code fix.
