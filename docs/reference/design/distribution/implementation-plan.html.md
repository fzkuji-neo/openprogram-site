# Installation and distribution implementation plan

This engineering record is intentionally separate from the authoritative HTML design.
It tracks the bounded implementation, verification, and review evidence for the current distribution work.

Formal release update architecture, implementation status, verification evidence,
and release-visible acceptance are maintained together in
`docs/reference/design/distribution/automatic-updates.html`. They are not
duplicated in this historical distribution ledger.

## Remove Python-package product installation

- Product contract: ordinary users install complete GitHub Release artifacts;
  `pip install openprogram`, `pipx install openprogram`, `uv tool install
  openprogram`, and the PyPI project page are not supported product entries.
- Public surfaces: the site index, onboarding/troubleshooting pages, examples,
  and runtime dependency errors point to the formal installer or a complete
  reinstall instead of asking users to mutate Python packages.
- Preserved developer boundary: release runtime assembly, source checkout
  development, tests, and explicitly developer-owned third-party extension
  environments may continue to build or install wheels internally.
- Public-entry RED: the distribution contract scans public documentation and
  product repair messages for Python-package installation instructions, while
  retaining assertions that the runtime builder still consumes the verified
  wheel.
- RED evidence: both focused cases failed: public surfaces still advertised
  Python-package installation, and packaged `openprogram browser install`
  invoked its Python installer.
- GREEN evidence: both focused cases pass. The affected distribution,
  Browser, Channels, Providers, OAuth, configuration, PDF, and embedding suites
  report 1,330 passed, 5 skipped, and 1 expected failure; the formal-release
  suite reports 21 passed. Documentation builds 529 pages, the landing check
  passes, and link validation reports zero broken links.
- Exclusions: no Python-free rewrite, no removal of `pyproject.toml`, no change
  to plugin or third-party Program formats, and no remote PyPI mutation.
- Specification review on `9e50cebc`: changes required because six first-party
  PDF Agentic Function errors still suggested `pip install pymupdf`, while the
  public-surface regression excluded the whole Agentic Functions tree.
- Repair: those built-in errors now direct users to reinstall the complete
  release, and the regression scans first-party Agentic Functions together with
  the rest of the product runtime. Developer-owned extension installers remain
  explicitly excluded.
- Specification re-review on `d9047511`: pass. The remaining Python package
  operations are limited to release assembly, source development, tests, and
  developer-owned extension environments.
- Quality review on `d9047511`: changes required because the OpenClaw source
  integration prepared a locked uv environment but its sample skill still ran
  with the unrelated system Python. It also found that the public built-in PDF
  capability depended on `pypdf`, but the complete runtime neither installed
  nor verified that dependency. The PDF failure messages also lacked the
  required repair action, and source troubleshooting incorrectly implied that
  running the checkout installer changed the shell's active Python. Finally,
  managed runtimes without Node or `apps/cli/dist` exited before the existing Rich
  terminal fallback, despite the release contract requiring a terminal UI.
- Repair: the OpenClaw skill now runs through `uv run --project` for the cloned
  checkout, with a regression covering both English and Chinese instructions.
  `pypdf` is now a locked base dependency; the runtime verifier imports it and
  executes both built-in PDF extraction paths against a generated PDF. Missing
  PDF dependencies direct a complete reinstall, while troubleshooting separates
  the managed private runtime from `uv run` or `.venv` source development.
  Ink startup failures now enter the bundled Rich REPL; `rich` is a direct,
  locked dependency with a runtime rendering probe and fallback regression.
- Final scoped reviews on `8c6b2f0c`: specification pass and quality pass.
  Distribution, formal release, Browser, and structured-output coverage reports
  123 passed; the independent release review including standalone coverage
  reports 120 passed; real PDF fixtures report 6 passed. Documentation builds
  529 pages, landing validation passes, and link validation reports zero broken
  links. A broader no-extra run stopped after 793 passed because its dev
  environment omitted Playwright; that failing case passes with the release
  runtime's `--extra all --extra search` configuration.
- Status: complete.

## Local App version coherence

- Public boundaries: `scripts/refresh-local-app.sh` only refreshes an installed
  App whose bundle, runtime manifest, Python distribution metadata, Python
  source version, and Desktop source version are identical.
  `apps/desktop/scripts/install-app.sh` rejects a candidate older than the current
  canonical App before lock acquisition, then copies and validates the candidate
  under the lock and compares that immutable staged version with the installed
  App before worker shutdown or filesystem mutation. Numeric version segments
  use decimal arbitrary-precision comparison. An existing canonical path that
  fails bundle, manifest, or embedded metadata validation is preserved and
  rejected rather than treated as absent. The same-version refresh copies the
  Desktop updater implementation into the rebuilt App archive, verifies the
  built wheel metadata, then reacquires the installer target lock and rechecks
  source, wheel, and installed App before any worker or App mutation.
- RED: the public installer accepted a 0.6.1 candidate over an installed 0.6.2
  App; the release-version entry did not recognize the installed-App source
  match request.
- GREEN: both focused public-entry cases pass. The real refresh command rejects
  a 0.6.6 checkout against the then-installed 0.6.1 App before creating build
  output, and the App files and healthy worker remain unchanged.
- Affected gate: formal release and distribution suites report 74 passed;
  release version, Ruff, shell syntax, and diff checks pass.
- Exclusions: no downgrade override, prerelease ordering, additional version
  source, user-state migration, Windows package, or remote release mutation.
- Status: implementation committed; independent specification review pending.

## Local canonical App and Apple icon batch

- Base commit: `9477273e`.
- Public entry: `npm --prefix apps/desktop run dist` builds one complete temporary
  `OpenProgram.app`, verifies it, and replaces only
  `/Applications/OpenProgram.app`.
- Icon contract: `apps/desktop/build/AppIcon.icon` is the Apple layered authoring
  source. Its four 1024 x 1024 SVG layers leave the system outline unmasked and
  preserve the approved brand ring and three nodes. Because the supported
  macOS 15 build host lacks the full Xcode `actool` pipeline, the reviewed
  `apps/desktop/build/icon.icns` is checked in as Electron's packaging input. The
  gate verifies both assets, all legacy representations, and the installed
  system contour; the removed hand-drawn outer-shape SVG must not return.
- Transaction contract: a failed activation never deletes the old App's only
  recoverable copy. A genuine launchd unload failure stops before App mutation;
  an unloaded stale plist can be replaced. A failure after Launch Services
  registration restores and re-registers the previous canonical App without
  replacing the original installation error. The assembled App passes the existing
  complete packaged-runtime smoke before installation.
- Concurrency contract: packaging uses one stable per-user lock across
  worktrees, and installation uses an atomic lock in the target Applications
  directory for the full transaction. A competing installer fails before App
  or service mutation and cannot create a nested bundle.
- Cleanup boundary: packaging removes its random App directory, staged runtime,
  Python wheel build, generated Web build/output, copied Web frontend, and lock.
  Installed App data, source files, package dependencies, and user state are not
  removed.
- Production files: `apps/desktop/build/AppIcon.icon`, `apps/desktop/build/icon.icns`,
  `apps/desktop/scripts/check-icon.sh`, `apps/desktop/scripts/package-and-install-app.sh`,
  `apps/desktop/scripts/install-app.sh`, and
  `openprogram/worker/services/launchd.py`.
- Acceptance: the icon gate requires a 1024 x 1024 source, transparent corners,
  the 824 x 824 opaque body bounds, a 256 px raster contour and solid-area
  profile aligned with built-in macOS Apps, all ten legacy representations, and
  an ICNS round trip; transaction fault injection preserves `previous.app`; launchd tests
  cover loaded, stale, and unload-failure states; a corrupt assembled runtime is
  rejected before installation. The runtime verifier also requires the installed
  OpenProgram package metadata to equal the runtime manifest version. After
  reviews, one real `npm run dist` replaces
  the installed App, Launch Services is refreshed, and Finder/Launchpad output is
  inspected.
- Exclusions: no Developer ID signing, notarization, Windows package, new icon
  dependency, second installed App, or generated-image model.
- Gate manifest: focused distribution tests, Desktop checks, icon generation and
  round-trip check, packaged-runtime smoke, documentation build/link check,
  Ruff, shell syntax, diff check, independent specification review, and fresh
  independent quality review.
- Installed acceptance (2026-08-16): one complete `npm run dist` build passed
  the runtime and packaged-App smokes, then atomically replaced
  `/Applications/OpenProgram.app`. The installed bundle reports version 0.6.6
  and identifier `ai.openprogram.desktop`; the runtime manifest, CLI version,
  and installed Python distribution metadata all report 0.6.6, and its ICNS
  SHA-256 matches the generated source asset. The default worker runs the bundle's CPython 3.12.10
  and `/healthz` reports `ok`. Launch Services reports the canonical 0.6.6 App,
  the Launchpad database contains its application item, and the visible Dock
  icon has the same footprint and corner profile as adjacent macOS Apps.
- Cleanup acceptance: only `/Applications/OpenProgram.app` remains; the random
  package directory, staged runtime, Python wheel build, Web `.next`/`out`, and
  copied frontend are absent after installation.
- Status: implemented, independently reviewed, installed, and visually accepted.

## Release gate repair for v0.6.1

- Removed four unreferenced legacy Channel modules after the implementations had moved under `openprogram/channels/implementations/`; the runtime HTTP inventory now scans only active Channel code.
- Renamed the Research writer's dropped `context` parameter to the runtime-supported `project_context` field.
- Recorded Browser Agent as an explicitly deferred internal tool loop without changing its current behavior.
- Local acceptance: the previously failing four tests pass; affected tests report 461 passed; the full non-integration suite reports 5274 passed, 11 skipped, and 1 expected failure. Desktop, Web, release-script, runtime-HTTP, Ruff, and documentation gates pass.
- This repair predates the native Windows artifacts. The current Windows release path is defined in [Windows support](windows-support.md).

### Native release result and v0.6.2 correction

- Tag `v0.6.1` remained immutable after release run `31820999574` failed while resolving the complete macOS x86_64 runtime. No GitHub Release was published from that tag.
- Root cause: `semble 0.2.0` constrained `tree-sitter-language-pack` below 1.8, and the locked 1.6.2 package published no macOS x86_64 wheel.
- Correction: require `semble>=0.5.3`, whose grammar dependency is `semble-grammars`; the locked grammar package publishes native wheels for macOS x86_64/arm64 and Linux x86_64/arm64 while preserving the search capability.
- Regression gate: resolve the complete locked product requirements for CPython 3.12 on macOS x86_64 and assert the locked grammar artifact includes that platform. The release retry uses the higher patch version `v0.6.2`.
- Tag `v0.6.2` remained immutable after run `31822787529` passed the search dependency step but found that `torch 2.13.0` no longer publishes macOS x86_64 wheels. No GitHub Release was published from that tag.
- The `v0.6.3` retry uses the last upstream macOS x86_64-compatible pair, `torch 2.2.2` and `torchvision 0.17.2`, together with `numpy 1.26.4` for NumPy ABI compatibility. All four release targets must resolve this same GUI stack; Linux continues to use the official CPU wheel index.
- Tag `v0.6.3` remained immutable after run `31823941178` showed that unconstrained GUI harness installation upgraded NumPy back to 2.x through the current OpenCV dependency, invalidating the Torch 2.2.2 NumPy ABI. No GitHub Release was published from that tag.
- The `v0.6.4` retry pins `opencv-python 4.11.0.86` and applies one constraints file to every first-party Program installation so later dependency resolution cannot replace the verified NumPy, OpenCV, Torch, or Torchvision stack.
- Tag `v0.6.4` remained immutable after run `31824996497` built and installed all four complete runtimes but exposed an architecture-name mismatch in the Intel macOS Desktop command: release archives use `x86_64`, while electron-builder accepts `x64`. No GitHub Release was published from that tag.
- The `v0.6.5` retry keeps runtime artifact naming unchanged and maps the Intel Desktop builder argument to `x64`; a release-workflow regression test enforces the explicit mapping for both macOS architectures.
- Tag `v0.6.5` remained immutable after run `31827207974` built both macOS Desktop artifacts but exposed that the packaged-runtime smoke script only parsed compact JSON while the runtime manifest is formatted JSON. All four complete runtime and CLI installer jobs passed; no GitHub Release was published from that tag.
- The `v0.6.6` retry uses the same whitespace-tolerant manifest parser already used by runtime archiving and Desktop preparation, reports actionable failures, and adds a regression test for formatted manifests.

### v0.6.6 formal release acceptance

- Tag `v0.6.6` points to `d08486953e19cf168fd8aba0704fe968b2a7f3a8`; release run `31829278086` completed successfully without moving any earlier tag.
- The stable GitHub Release was published at `https://github.com/fzkuji-neo/OpenProgram/releases/tag/v0.6.6` as a non-draft, non-prerelease release. It contains four complete runtime archives and checksums, unsigned macOS arm64/x64 DMG and ZIP artifacts and checksums, developer wheel/sdist artifacts, and `release-manifest.json`.
- Native release acceptance passed for macOS arm64/x86_64 and Linux arm64/x86_64. Each runtime was assembled and archived on its native runner; all four CLI installer jobs verified checksum, extraction, complete-product capabilities, worker cold start, atomic activation, and launcher version. Both macOS Desktop jobs verified the same embedded runtime before uploading their artifacts.
- Main CI run `31828655714` passed Python 3.11/3.12/3.13, Web, and documentation/example jobs. The documentation publication run `31828655717` also passed.
- Post-release public-entry acceptance resolved `https://openprogram.io/install` through GitHub `latest` to `v0.6.6`, installed the macOS arm64 archive into an isolated state and launcher directory, reported `openprogram 0.6.6`, passed the installer's complete-runtime and `/healthz` probes, and passed `openprogram doctor`.

### v0.7.0 browser-focused release acceptance

- Tag `v0.7.0` resolves to `c7f5916b2b3acb67b936081763945ee080f81b9a`; it was created once after main CI run `31973024049` and documentation publication run `31973024046` completed successfully.
- Release run `31973458867` completed successfully. Four native product-runtime jobs, four CLI installer jobs, both macOS Desktop jobs, the Python distribution job, and the final publish job passed.
- The stable [OpenProgram 0.7.0 Release](https://github.com/fzkuji-neo/OpenProgram/releases/tag/v0.7.0) is non-draft and non-prerelease. At that acceptance checkpoint, GitHub `latest` resolved to `v0.7.0`. Its 17 uploaded assets comprise four runtime archives and their checksums, arm64/x64 unsigned DMG and ZIP artifacts and checksum lists, developer wheel/sdist artifacts, and `release-manifest.json`.
- The published manifest reports version `0.7.0`; its byte counts and SHA-256 values match the GitHub asset metadata for both macOS Desktop architectures and all four runtime archives.
- Release acceptance used CI package/runtime smoke and read-only release metadata checks. It did not install, replace, activate, or restart the user's current `/Applications/OpenProgram.app`, so foreground updater UI, long-running scheduling, and sleep/resume behavior remain explicitly unverified.
- The browser release scope includes the built-in Browser, profile import, bookmarks/history, and Agent-bound WebTab control. Chrome/Edge extension installation is intentionally excluded and documented in the authoritative built-in browser design and product FAQ.

### Current v0.9.8 release acceptance

- The release candidate integrates durable function code selection and restart recovery with module organization and recoverable file operations. Existing local signing, permission, cancellation and uncertain-effect boundaries remain authoritative.
- Source, lockfile, Desktop and installer versions agree. Release acceptance requires the combined Python regression manifest, Desktop checks, documentation checks and independent specification and quality reviews.
- Publication requires successful native runtime, Desktop and CLI installer jobs, followed by release manifest and asset verification.
- Public macOS desktop packages are Developer ID signed and Apple notarized. Local refresh and self-update reuse the local development certificate and do not preserve the production signature.
- Runtime capability verification and checksum requirements remain unchanged. Windows Desktop publication requires configured signing credentials.

## Short public installer batch

- Base commit: `c1886a3fdf7ba196c42ec9a2c19dca7fe86c12e7`.
- Public command: `curl -fsSL https://openprogram.io/install | sh` for normal macOS/Linux CLI and server installations.
- Boundary: the root script resolves the latest stable GitHub Release, validates a three-part numeric version, downloads the immutable tagged installer, and forwards the version. It does not assemble a second installer and does not weaken runtime checksum, capability-manifest, or worker cold-start verification.
- Reproducibility: advanced users and CI may pass `OPENPROGRAM_VERSION=X.Y.Z` to the `sh` process. The tagged `scripts/install-release.sh` remains the published compatibility URL and downloads the authoritative `scripts/release/install-release.sh` implementation from the same immutable tag.
- Publication: `docs/_static_root/install.sh` must be renamed to the deployed site root as `/install`; `/docs/install/` remains the installation documentation directory.
- Tests: execute the public root script with a fake `curl` for automatic latest-version resolution and explicit pinning, assert the tagged installer handoff, build the docs site, verify the assembled root file, and run the existing distribution release suite.
- RED evidence: the two public-entry tests initially failed because the root bootstrap did not exist and the Pages workflow did not publish `/install`.
- GREEN evidence: the distribution release file reports 25 passed; docs build reports 509 pages; landing check passes; link check reports 0 broken links; an assembled-site probe preserves `/docs/install/` and validates the root `/install` script.
- Pre-release evidence on 2026-08-15: GitHub `latest` initially resolved to `v0.6.0`, whose release had no assets and whose tag had no `scripts/install-release.sh`. The installer correctly failed instead of installing a reduced product. The `v0.6.6` formal release acceptance above supersedes that observed release state.

## Unified complete-product batch

- Base commit: `e6ec8694977080153a3c94e50a5080d2ff43b69b`.
- Product contract: every supported non-developer installation contains the same complete capability set for its platform and architecture. A Desktop artifact must use the same runtime archive as CLI/server and may differ only by its Electron shell. If that complete packaged entry does not pass, the Desktop artifact is absent rather than reduced.
- Required capabilities: Web, providers, MCP, memory, channels, search, Playwright Chromium, the GPA detector model, and the GUI, Research, and Wiki first-party Programs. Research includes its PDF support. The product runtime explicitly excludes PyTorch, torchvision, OpenCV, EasyOCR, sentence-transformers, triton, and NVIDIA/CUDA distributions.
- Developer installations add editable sources, tests, diagnostics, local frontend builds, and explicitly configured GUI perception/OCR/browser overlays. Paths that need excluded perception dependencies are not product-manifest capabilities. The product runtime never implicitly installs excluded dependencies; model assets required by an explicit overlay remain that overlay's setup responsibility.
- Ordinary users install from GitHub Release artifacts. PyPI wheels remain internal build inputs and developer artifacts, not a product installation path.
- macOS artifacts are explicitly unsigned DMG/ZIP files. Apple Developer ID signing and notarization are not release requirements. Linux publishes complete x86_64/arm64 CLI/server runtimes; no Linux Desktop artifact is published after the complete AppImage failed its packaging gate.
- This batch originally shipped without Windows artifacts. The same runtime/Desktop separation now produces native Windows x64 and arm64 runtime, installer, and Desktop artifacts as defined in [Windows support](windows-support.md). OS credential-store integration remains excluded.

### Current-batch files

- Product contract: `docs/reference/design/distribution/installation-packaging.html` and this implementation record.
- Runtime assembly: a checked-in product manifest, runtime builder/archive scripts, desktop runtime staging, and the CLI release installer.
- Launchers: Electron and CLI launch paths that set bundled Playwright Chromium and GPA detector locations and validate the capability manifest. Session and Memory Git history use the host's system Git; neither launcher bundles Git.
- Release: `.github/workflows/release.yml`, desktop artifact naming, runtime archives, checksums, and public-entry smoke checks.
- Product documentation: install, desktop, server, upgrade, Programs, and README entry points that describe one complete product rather than optional first-party components.
- Tests: `tests/unit/test_distribution_release.py` plus focused Program/runtime and packaged-entry probes.

### Current-batch public-entry acceptance

1. Each platform runtime archive contains a manifest with `present` and `verified` entries for `web`, `providers`, `mcp`, `memory`, `channels`, `search`, `browser.playwright`, `model.gpa_detector`, `program.gui`, `program.research`, and `program.wiki`. GUI installs with `--no-deps`; Research installs with its PDF support. The archive does not install PyTorch, torchvision, OpenCV, EasyOCR, sentence-transformers, triton, or NVIDIA/CUDA distributions.
2. Supported Desktop packaging consumes the already-built runtime archive. The CLI installer consumes the byte-identical archive from GitHub Release. Neither path resolves product dependencies independently.
3. A normal-user install performs no PyPI dependency resolution, repository clone, npm build, or first-use download for Playwright Chromium, the GPA detector, or first-party Programs. It also never downloads excluded GUI perception dependencies implicitly; users must configure an explicit development or backend overlay for those paths.
4. Public-entry probes verify the worker, Web assets, first-party Program registration, channel/search imports, Playwright Chromium executable, and detector model before an artifact is published or a CLI `current` link is switched.
5. macOS artifact names and documentation state `unsigned`; the release workflow requires no Apple or PyPI credentials and does not run signing, notarization, or PyPI publication.
6. Documentation does not present `pip install openprogram`, optional GUI/Research/Wiki installation, component-selection prompts, or an unverified Linux Desktop package as normal product installation.

### Current-batch gate manifest

```text
python -m pytest tests/unit/test_distribution_release.py tests/unit/test_desktop_packaged_files.py tests/unit/test_webui_frontend.py
python -m scripts.docs_site.checklinks

npm run check --prefix desktop
npm run check --prefix web
bash -n scripts/release/build-product-runtime.sh scripts/install-release.sh scripts/release/prepare-desktop-runtime.sh
git diff --check
git status --short
```

The platform runtime and public desktop artifact probes run on native release runners. A platform artifact is absent rather than published with a reduced capability manifest.

### Current-batch evidence

| Field | Evidence |
|---|---|
| RED | The first focused distribution run reported 6 expected failures: no product manifest, no unified runtime builder, the CLI installer still resolved a wheel, Desktop and CLI assembled dependencies independently, and the workflow still required Apple/PyPI publication paths. |
| Static GREEN | Distribution, packaged-file, and Web frontend suite: 35 passed after removing the unverified Linux Desktop target. Desktop and Web checks, shell syntax, Ruff, docs build (507 pages), link check (0 broken), and diff checks passed. |
| Current macOS arm64 runtime boundary | CPython 3.12.10, locked OpenProgram dependencies, GUI/Research/Wiki pinned commits, Playwright Chromium, GPA detector, Research PDF support, and all 11 manifest capabilities are packaged. GUI installs with `--no-deps`; excluded GUI perception dependencies are not part of the product runtime. |
| Runtime verification | The schema 2 verifier launches a real headless Chromium page, imports channels/search/PDF dependencies, checks Web assets and the GPA detector file, requires GUI/Research/Wiki registration, and rejects PyTorch, torchvision, OpenCV, EasyOCR, sentence-transformers, triton, and NVIDIA/CUDA distributions. It records the product-manifest hash, `uv.lock` hash, exact installed distributions, platform, and architecture. |
| Archive and CLI entry | A macOS arm64 archive was checksum-verified, extracted into a new CLI version directory, re-verified, cold-started and stopped a worker, switched `current`, and produced a working `openprogram 0.6.1` launcher. |
| Native Linux run | GitHub Actions run `31809407776` at `c49596ef` built and verified the complete Linux x86_64 and arm64 runtimes. Both CLI installer jobs passed checksum, extraction, capability verifier, worker cold-start, atomic activation, and version probes. The AppImage job failed during electron-builder's embedded block-map stage after the complete runtime itself passed; no AppImage reached public-entry or Debian 11 verification. |
| Packaging decision | Linux AppImage build and publication were removed. Linux remains supported through the complete x86_64/arm64 CLI/server archives with Web UI and TUI. No reduced Linux Desktop artifact is offered. |
| Final Linux gate | GitHub Actions run `31811091609` at `08a9a19a` passed all four remaining jobs: complete x86_64 and arm64 runtime build/archive plus x86_64 and arm64 CLI public-entry installation. The workflow contains no Linux Desktop packaging job. |
| Full local gate | `tests/ --ignore=tests/integration`: 5285 passed, 11 skipped, 1 xfailed, 5 failed. Four deterministic failures are outside this batch (two existing channel HTTP inventory failures, one Research `context` parameter failure, and one browser-agent migration inventory failure). The fifth was a multiprocessing timeout and passed immediately in isolation. |
| Review | Ponytail full review removed the first-party selection menu and reduced the model to one manifest, one builder, one verifier, and existing shell/workflow entry points. Manual specification review found and fixed unlocked dependency resolution, non-canonical archive roots, missing archive checksum/path validation, Playwright cleanup warnings, and the Research PDF extra. |
| Incremental commits | Design commit `e2a1b691`, implementation commit `c75099d2`, and complete-install follow-up `685833cc` were merged and pushed incrementally; the follow-up reached `main` in `c49596ef`. |

## Prior packaging batch (historical evidence)

- Base commit: `717d4e176307e08cc4ae4facd3c484511684746c`.
- Public behavior: released wheels serve prebuilt Web assets without Node.js; packaged Electron apps start an embedded CPython runtime; macOS builds DMG and ZIP artifacts; Linux builds AppImage artifacts; release CI verifies versions and checksums.
- Product documentation describes only behavior whose acceptance checks pass.
- Windows native packaging was not implemented in this historical batch; it remains a deferred product decision rather than a rejected direction.
- OS credential-store integration remains excluded.

### Prior-batch files

- Production: `apps/server/openprogram_server/_webui/frontend.py`, `pyproject.toml`, `apps/desktop/main.js`, `apps/desktop/package.json`, release staging scripts, and the release workflow.
- Tests: frontend package-resource tests, desktop packaged-runtime checks, and release configuration checks.
- Documentation: the distribution HTML design, related design links, and install/upgrade/desktop/server product pages.

### Prior-batch public-entry acceptance

1. A wheel built after release asset staging contains `openprogram_server/_webui/_frontend/index.html` and hashed Next.js assets; an isolated wheel install serves `/chat` without repository sources or Node.js.
2. A packaged Electron launch resolves the Python executable exclusively from `process.resourcesPath`, invokes `-I -B -m openprogram worker start`, does not fall back to `PATH`, and does not write bytecode into the signed application.
3. `electron-builder` declares macOS DMG/ZIP and Linux AppImage targets and includes the staged runtime as an immutable resource.
4. A tag-triggered release workflow builds each platform on its native runner, runs focused acceptance checks, and publishes checksums only after artifacts exist.

### Prior-batch full gate manifest

```text
python -m pytest tests/component/webui/runtime/test_webui_frontend.py tests/unit/webui/test_desktop_packaged_files.py tests/component/config/test_distribution_release.py
python -m scripts.docs_site.checklinks
python -m scripts.docs_site.build
python -m pytest tests/ --ignore=tests/integration
npm run check --prefix desktop
npm run check --prefix web
git diff --check
git status --short
```

Platform artifact builds run in the release workflow because a macOS host cannot validate a Linux CPython/AppImage runtime and a Linux host cannot sign or notarize a macOS app.

### Prior Linux completion batch

- Base commit: `540591e9f628498dee87a1c2ebb30ab4c5e757f6`.
- Production files: `apps/desktop/package.json`, `scripts/release/smoke-packaged-runtime.sh`, `scripts/install-release.sh`, `.github/workflows/release.yml`, and `.github/workflows/linux-release-smoke.yml`.
- Test file: `tests/unit/test_distribution_release.py`.
- Linux x86_64 acceptance: build the AppImage on a native x86_64 runner, execute its public entry under Xvfb, let Electron start the embedded worker, verify `/healthz`, `/chat`, immutable Program behavior, and matching freedesktop filename/`StartupWMClass` metadata.
- Linux CLI acceptance: on native x86_64 and arm64 runners, install the release wheel with the pinned uv and managed CPython, cold-start the worker before switching `current`, and verify the installed launcher version.
- Pre-release execution: the manually dispatched Linux smoke workflow requires no Apple signing or PyPI credentials and uploads the verified wheel and AppImage only as CI artifacts. It does not create a stable release.
- This historical batch predates the Windows implementation and did not add Linux arm64 desktop artifacts, distro-native deb/rpm packages, or OS credential-store integration. The current Windows release path is defined in [Windows support](windows-support.md).

### Prior-batch ledger

| Field | Evidence |
|---|---|
| Base | `717d4e176307e08cc4ae4facd3c484511684746c` |
| CodeGraph | Repository index was available in the shared checkout for initial exploration; the isolated worktree had no `.codegraph/`, so implementation lookup used targeted `rg` and direct reads. |
| RED | Initial focused run: 5 failed and 10 passed; failures covered missing package-resource frontend selection, desktop targets/runtime resolution, release installer, and release workflow. |
| GREEN | Focused distribution/desktop suite: 25 passed; docs build produced 503 pages with 0 broken links; desktop and Web npm checks passed; clean wheel import, managed CLI install, and rebuilt macOS arm64 packaged worker smoke passed. |
| Specification review | Local design-to-implementation audit passed after adding final-DMG notarization/stapling, runtime-manifest schema/version validation, and removal of remaining public Windows-native/any-platform claims. Two bounded CodeBuddy review attempts returned no output and were terminated, so no external-review pass is claimed. |
| Quality review | Ponytail full audit found no new dependency or packaging abstraction to remove. Shell/YAML syntax checks, diff checks, focused tests, the rebuilt app smoke, and runtime signature-stability check passed. The release workflow now writes the App Store Connect key with owner-only permissions and uses the protected `release` environment. |
| Full gate | `tests/ --ignore=tests/integration`: 5254 passed, 11 skipped, 1 xfailed, 3 failed. The failures are outside the distribution changes: two runtime HTTP inventory tests report unregistered channel transports, and one agent-tool test reports a dropped `context` parameter in the research program. Change-specific Python, docs, desktop, Web, shell, YAML, wheel, CLI installer, and packaged-runtime gates are green. |
| Dependency audit | No dependency was added. Existing lockfiles report 7 desktop npm advisories (2 moderate, 5 high) and 8 Web npm advisories (high); remediation is separate dependency-maintenance work. |
| Release-only evidence | Developer ID signing, Apple notarization, macOS x64 artifacts, GitHub Release creation, and PyPI publication still require the tag workflow and protected credentials. Linux x86_64 AppImage startup and Linux x86_64/arm64 CLI installation now have separate native-runner evidence. |
| Implementation commits | Initial batches: `714981e1`, `9e1e5e0a`, and `dddea787`. Linux completion batches: `a170ca65`, `78e78921`, `41b39e86`, `63f15e65`, and `b7220c89`; all were merged and pushed incrementally to `main`. |

### Prior Linux completion evidence

| Field | Evidence |
|---|---|
| RED | The old Linux smoke extracted the AppImage and launched embedded Python directly, so it did not test the public Electron entry. The first native workflow run then exposed electron-builder's implicit CI publish attempt. A clean arm64 container exposed zombie PID handling during worker stop. A running-worker upgrade probe exposed shared user-state interference. |
| GREEN | Distribution suite: 18 passed. Desktop and Web checks passed. Documentation link check reported 0 broken links and the static builder produced 503 pages. |
| Native Linux | GitHub Actions run `31798379681` at pushed `main` commit `17db67dc` passed the x86_64 AppImage job, x86_64 CLI job, and arm64 CLI job. That historical AppImage smoke used Debian 11/glibc 2.31 with no system Python, Node.js, Git, or external network, but did not exercise Session/Memory Git history and is not evidence that current product use can omit system Git. |
| CLI isolation | A historical native arm64 Debian 12 probe with no system Python, Node.js, or Git installed uv 0.11.16, managed CPython 3.12.10, and the 0.6.1 wheel. It tested installer isolation and worker preservation only; current Session/Memory history still requires host Git. |
| Specification review | Manual design-to-implementation review found and fixed public-entry coverage, freedesktop window association, implicit publishing, probe state isolation, and the clean-install doctor wording. A bounded CodeBuddy review attempt exhausted its turn limit without a verdict, so no external specification pass is claimed. |
| Quality review | Ponytail full review kept the implementation in existing shell scripts and workflows, added no runtime dependency, and rejected a separate doctor mode. A bounded CodeBuddy quality review returned tool-call text without a verdict, so no external quality pass is claimed. |
| Stable release | No `v0.6.1` tag was created. The GitHub `release` environment and Apple signing secrets are absent; the external PyPI trusted-publisher configuration is not verifiable from this repository. Signed macOS artifacts and the atomic GitHub/PyPI stable release therefore remain blocked. |
