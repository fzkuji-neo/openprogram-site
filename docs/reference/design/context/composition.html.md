# Composition

> This document defines **what gets fed into each LLM call**. It does not enumerate a fixed set of components — that would hard-code them and prevent extension. It defines **a set of rules plus a registration mechanism**: how components are assigned to layers, how they are ordered, and how they appear conditionally. Concrete components are **registered** by individual features, so adding a feature does not change the framework.
>
> The three layers follow Hermes's stable/context/volatile split, which corresponds to our L0/L1/L2. The difference is in how components reach the layers: Hermes assembles its three layers through a hard-wired if chain, so adding new guidance means editing a central function. Here the layers are a registry — open for extension, closed for modification.
>
> The premise is the paper's "LLM-as-Code — the model is one part inside a program." Each time this part is called it needs to know its situation (who am I / who called me / which step I'm at), while seeing only the history it should see: results, not the internal process of every sub-function.

---

## 1. The Three-Layer Criterion: Where Does the Information Flow

The criterion = **"after this call ends, where does this information flow."** Think of the current call as a child node:

| Layer | Level | Criterion | Content | Wire position |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **L0** | System level | **Always carried** — unchanged across the whole session | identity/instructions/tools/skills/global memory/environment | Frontmost · tools + system header |
| **L1** | Session level | **Kept for what follows** — append-grows, stable prefix | project layer + **unified call tree** (history) | Middle · appended, cache-friendly |
| **L2** | Task level | **Purely this call** — fully changes each time | situation (where I am in the tree) + this call's input + output format | Last · not cached |

### The core of L1: a single unified call tree

L1 history **is a call tree** — it is essentially **one active path** of the entire context DAG (the path from the root to the current node; other paths on the DAG, such as branches/retries, are not on this one). So it is **a clean tree/chain, with no branch merges and no cycles**.

This tree:
- **Records all function calls** (whether or not they call the LLM), with each node carrying its call logic.
- **LLM-related io** (model input/output, produced content) is attached to the corresponding node → the tree itself is the complete context.
- **Append-grows**: each call adds at most one or two lines at the end (expanding the structure of the new node), **the old prefix stays untouched**.
- **Release on completion**: once a child node (sub-function) finishes, **release its io, keep only the call logic + key output**; the release happens in the later part of the tree (the block that just completed), **leaving earlier old nodes untouched** → only a small tail segment of the cache is lost.

### Why the call tree and history are merged into one (rather than split into two layers)

Their content is the same batch of DAG nodes; splitting them (structure in one place, io in another) would make the "structure block that changes each time" a separate layer, and **that block would never hit the cache**. After merging them into a single append-only tree: growth happens only at the end, release happens only at the end, and the old prefix is stable → **large segments hit the cache**, only a small tail is recomputed. Managing it piece-by-piece by appending actually yields better caching than "two separate blocks each changing." And because structure + content are one, the model follows a single tree to see clearly "where I am + what happened along the way," without having to infer the connection.

### L2 is left with only "purely this call"

Once the call tree goes into L1, L2 no longer has any "history/results" — the results are already in the nodes of that L1 tree. L2 keeps only the instructions that **direct how to do this one call**: situation (which node in the tree I'm at, the call path), this call's input, output format / contract. These fully change each time, go last, and are not cached.

---

## 2. The Registration Model

Rather than enumerating components, the design defines **a unified component interface plus three registration lists**. The framework handles only the rules; components are registration entries.

### Component interface

```python
@dataclass
class ContextComponent:
    name: str                          # identifier
    layer: Literal["L0", "L1", "L2"]   # which layer it belongs to (criterion in §1)
    order: int                         # in-layer ordering: more stable = smaller (see §3)
    condition: Callable[[Ctx], bool]   # appearance condition (enters context only if True; unconditional = always True)
    build: Callable[[Ctx], str | None] # generate this block when the condition holds (None = empty this time)
    cacheable: bool = True             # whether it participates in the cache prefix
```

### The three registration lists + assembly rules

L0 / L1 / L2 each maintain a registration list. When the framework assembles:

```
For each layer:
  collect all registered components of that layer
  → sort by order (more stable = earlier)
  → filter out those whose condition(ctx) is False (feature absent/inapplicable, automatically absent)
  → build(ctx) each remaining one, concatenate into the layer's content
Finally: tools(L0) → system(L0 + L1 project layer) → messages(L1 history + L2)
```

### Why this stays extensible

- **Adding a new feature** (multi-agent, new channel, new provider, new tool guidance): the feature side **registers one ContextComponent**, declaring layer/order/condition/build, and **no framework code changes**.
- **Unneeded features**: don't register them, and they cost nothing; register later if you need them.
- The framework manages **rules** (three-layer criterion, ordering, registration interface); components are an **open set**. Hermes instead hard-codes components into its build function, so adding one requires editing that central function.

> Hermes has registration at two touch points only, the memory provider and the platform hint; its core guidance (tool awareness, model-specific, platform format) is a hard-coded if chain. Here registration covers **all components**, tool guidance, model guidance, and platform format included — each is a registration entry carrying its own condition.

---

## 3. In-Layer Ordering Rules

Within a layer, items are also sorted by stability: **more stable = earlier, more frequently changing = later** (cache prefix matching means in-layer order affects hits too). The `order` field is exactly this ordering. Append-each-turn items like history go last within their layer.

```
tools    = L0[toolset, MCP]                               ← unchanged across the session · breakpoint①
system   = L0[overall identity → guidance blocks → skills/tools → global memory → environment info]  ← unchanged · breakpoint②
         + L1[project identity → project memory → USER profile → cwd → bindings]   ← changes only on project switch · breakpoint③
messages = L1[unified call tree …append-grows, completed nodes release io…]      ← stable prefix, cache-friendly · breakpoint④
         + L2[situation → git/todo → prefetch → this call's input → output spec] ← fully changes each time, not cached
```

Key points:
- Within L0: identity/guidance/tools are the most stable, placed first; environment info (OS/backend/date), although stable across the session, is closer to changeable, placed at the tail of L0.
- Within L1: project-fixed info (identity/memory/USER/cwd/bindings) goes first; **the unified call tree append-grows, placed last in L1** — it grows at the tail / releases at the tail, with a stable prefix → large segments hit the cache.
- Within L2: everything is purely this-call and fully changes each time; situation (where I am in the tree) goes first, this call's input / output spec come after.
- **L2 (changes each time) must be placed after the L1 call tree** — if the per-call situation/call structure were placed before the call tree, it would invalidate the cache of that large, stable tree behind it. This is a hard constraint of layer assignment (see §1 "why merge into one").

> The diagram above is the **design/cache view** (marking each layer's position + breakpoints). What the model actually receives is one continuous block of text, **with none of the "L0/L1/L2/breakpoint" wording** — the layering is merely our basis for organizing content and placing cache breakpoints; it is not written into the prompt. See the example in §6.

---

## 4. Registered Components

The registered components are listed below with their `order` and `condition`. The set grows as features are added; it is a snapshot, not a limit.

### L0 system level

| order | Component | condition | Registered as |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | overall identity ("you are X agent") | always | identity |
| 2 | inline agent prompt | present if any | inline_prompt |
| 3 | tool enforcement (act-don't-ask) | always (can be per-model) | tool_enforcement |
| 4 | model-specific operation guidance | per current provider/model | model_guidance (_MODEL_GUIDANCE, one entry per provider) |
| 5 | platform rendering format | per current channel | platform_format (contextvar + _PLATFORM_RULES per channel) |
| 6 | computer-use guidance | computer-use tool enabled | not registered |
| 7 | skill index | enabled skills present | skills_index |
| 8 | tools + MCP schema | always | — |
| 9 | global/user-level memory | present | memory_global |
| 10 | environment info (OS/shell/remote backend) | always | environment (OS/shell; cwd handled separately by tool-runtime) |

### L1 session/project level

| order | Component | condition | Registered as |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | project identity (AGENTS.md) | project file present | workspace_files |
| 2 | prompt-injection detection (scan 1 before injecting) | when loading project files | pi_shield + detect_injection_patterns |
| 3 | context file truncation | project file oversized | MAX_WORKSPACE_CHARS=8000 truncation inside workspace_files |
| 4 | project-level memory | present | — |
| 5 | USER.md user profile | present | user_profile (loaded by workspace_files via read_user_md) |
| 6 | working directory cwd | always | — |
| 7 | whether in a git repo | in a git repo | git_repo_flag |
| 8 | session/model/thinking/tier bindings | always | — |
| 9 | deferred tools catalog | deferred tools present | deferred_catalog (order 25) |
| 10 | current date (day granularity) | always | current_date (order 85, L1 tail) |
| 11 | **unified call tree (history)** | history present | append-grows, completed nodes release io, placed last in L1 |

> The date sits at the **tail of L1**, not in L0. It is the one component that changes on its own — at midnight, with nothing in the session having changed. Placed in L0 it would precede the tools, memory, and workspace blocks, so a rollover mid-session would invalidate the entire cached prefix. At the L1 tail only what follows it is lost.

> Item 10 is the core of L1: the entire DAG's current active path is rendered as a call tree carrying io (see §1). DAG / ContextCommit / tool-aging / summarize supply the underlying "node + compaction" machinery; the default rendering is that a completed child node releases io and keeps only its logic plus key output, corresponding to the default `expose=io`, so the tree append-grows and the prefix stays stable.

### L2 task level (purely this call, no history — history is already in the L1 call tree)

**L2 has no registered components, by design.** `build_system_prompt` assembles L0 + L1 only, so a component registered into L2 would never reach the wire. L2 content is delivered through the turn's messages instead — which is where per-call content belongs anyway, since putting it on the system prompt would place it *before* the cached history rather than after it.

| order | Content | condition | Delivered by |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | this call's situation | called inside an Agent method | _situational_prefix + _compute_call_path, prefixed to the call's message |
| 2 | per-turn memory prefetch | relevant memory retrieved | `_inject_memory_prefetch`, a prefix block inside the current user message |
| 3 | this call's user input + attachments | always | the user message itself |
| 4 | output format / schema | required by this step | inlined into the situation block |
| 5 | output contract output_contract | this step has a downstream | rendered as the `Your output:` line inside _situational_prefix |

`git_status` and `todo_progress` were once registered here. Nothing assembled L2, so they were dead registrations that no model ever saw — and `git_status` additionally spent ~44ms shelling out to git on every component sweep to build a string that was then discarded. Both are removed. Anything genuinely task-scoped goes into the turn's messages, the way the memory prefetch does.

### Slots left unregistered

Kanban multi-agent coordination, Nous subscription guidance, and the Hermes profile mechanism have no counterpart feature here, so nothing is registered for them. Building such a feature later means registering a ContextComponent of its own; the framework does not change.

## 4'. Prompt Templates for Each Component

This section gives the prompt template for each key component: the model-facing prompt body (in English, matching the existing skills and situational blocks), its placeholders, and its registration parameters (layer/order/condition). A component's `build()` produces this text directly. The format follows `_situational_prefix` (`[…]` tags) and Hermes GUIDANCE (`# heading` + `<tag>` blocks).

### 1. situation (L2 · order 1 · condition: called inside an Agent method)

The `_situational_prefix` block does more than prevent recursion: it also carries the function's responsibility, call path, program position, and output destination.

Block with **paired XML tags** (`<situation>…</situation>`), not `#` headings — boundaries are explicit, and any `#`/code/markdown appearing in the content won't be confused with the block delimiters (the same convention as Claude Code's `<system-reminder>`, etc.).

```text
<situation>
You are running INSIDE the agentic function `{fn_name}`.
Job: {fn_doc}
Call path: {call_path}
Position: {program_position}
Your output: {output_contract}

The tool list may include `{fn_name}` itself — do NOT call it (re-entering
causes infinite recursion). Use lower-level tools to do the work directly.
</situation>
```

Placeholders:
- `{fn_name}` current function name · `{fn_doc}` the first sentence of its docstring (responsibility)
- `{call_path}` the call chain, e.g. `research_agent → _pick_stage → literature → seed_surveys`
- `{program_position}` the position in the program, e.g. `step 1 of the literature stage, next → extract_framework`
- `{output_contract}` see the next item (rendered inline within this block, not as a separate block)

> The last two sentences are the recursion-prevention paragraph; the lines above them describe the situation.

### 2. output_contract (L2 · inlined into situation)

How the output is used, in one sentence. The template is one of three, by consumption mode:

```text
[parsed into a decision]
Your output will be parsed by the caller into a decision — emit exactly one
JSON object matching the menu below.

[writing a file / deliverable]
Your output becomes `{artifact}`, the deliverable consumed by `{consumer}`.

[passed to the next function]
Your output is passed to `{next_fn}` as its `{param}`.
```

### 3. environment block (L0 · order 10 · condition: always)

OS / shell / cwd / remote backend combined into one block (following Hermes build_environment_hints).

```text
<environment>
- OS: {os}  ·  Shell: {shell}
- Working directory: {cwd}
- Runtime: {backend}            # local / Docker / Modal / SSH:host
</environment>
```

> cwd is also the L1 working-directory component; this environment block holds only "machine/platform" items (OS/shell/backend), with cwd handled by the L1 component, to avoid duplication — at implementation time render one of the two, with cwd defaulting to L1.

### 4. current date (L0 · order 11 · condition: always)

Day granularity (not minutes), cache-friendly.

```text
Today is {weekday}, {month} {day}, {year}.
```

### 5. model-specific guidance (L0 · order 4 · condition: per provider/model)

A general skeleton, with each provider registering one entry to fill in (distilled from Hermes OPENAI_MODEL_EXECUTION_GUIDANCE).

```text
[Execution guidance ({provider})]
<tool_use>
- Use tools when they improve correctness or grounding; don't stop early when
  another call would materially help.
</tool_use>
<verify>
- Check prerequisites before acting; verify results before declaring done.
</verify>
{provider_extra}     # per-provider extras, e.g. Gemini's "use absolute paths"
```

### 6. platform rendering format (L0 · order 5 · condition: per channel)

Each channel registers one skeleton (we have wechat / slack / discord / telegram).

```text
[Output channel: {channel}]
{format_rule}
```

`{format_rule}` examples:
- telegram/discord: `Use Markdown. Wrap code in fences. Keep replies focused.`
- wechat: `Plain text only — no Markdown. Short paragraphs.`
- sms: `Plain text, ≤ {limit} chars, no formatting.`

### 7. call tree format: YAML (L1 · order 10 · default expose=io)

The call tree is **fed to the model as YAML** (not an ASCII tree drawing). Reasons: the model is very familiar with YAML, it saves tokens, hierarchy is by indentation, **multi-line io uses a `|` block without breaking the structure**, and io sits right inside the node object (not decoupled). If `├─ │` tree drawings appear elsewhere in the docs, they are only human-facing illustrations — what's actually fed to the model is the YAML below.

Fields (full names, not abbreviated):

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `function` | function name |
| `input` | input (kept in full while running / not yet released; long text uses a `\|` block) |
| `output` | output (same as above; long text uses a `\|` block) |
| `status` | `running` (currently running) / `done` (completed and io released) |
| `children` | child calls (nested, recursing per the §6 criterion) |

Format:

```yaml
# running / io not yet released: carries full input/output, multi-line uses a | block
- function: seed_surveys
  input: "query: LLM agent frameworks surveys …"
  output: |
    surveys:
      1. arXiv:2603.22386  "From Static Templates to Dynamic Runtime"
      2. arXiv:2601.xxxxx  "Agentic Runtime Graphs"
      … (N papers, kept in full, not abbreviated)

# completed and io released (level two): keep structure, mark only status, key output may keep one line
- function: _lit_decide
  status: done
```

**Level two**: after a subtree completes, **the structure of its child nodes (those `function` lines) is fully kept** (the model can still see which steps produced it), only each child node's actual `input`/`output` is **released** (marked `status: done`); the subtree root's own key output (e.g. framework) is kept as a summary.

> Structure is cheap → keep it all (a history safety net); io is expensive → release on completion. This is the default `expose=io`; with `expose=llm/full` even internal LLM interactions are expanded, and when `render_range` narrows, even structure may be kept less (see §5).

---

## 5. Defaults and Configurability (expose / render_range)

§4 describes the **default** case. How much history is passed between parent and child is decided by two knobs (see `overview.md`):

| Knob | What it controls | Default | Default effect |
|---|---|---|---|
| `expose` | how much a function exposes of itself to the outside | `io` | parent and child pass only the interface (identity + input + output), not internal steps |
| `render_range` | how much history the current call pulls upward/inward | unlimited | L1 history is pulled along the full chain, compacted only when over budget |

"The child sees only the parent's interface, not the parent's internals" is a result of the `expose=io` default, not an iron law. Typically a function also calls only one child function, so the default suffices. To let some function see more (`expose=llm/full`) or less (narrowing `render_range`), just change its declaration.

> The landing point of the paper's "context length determined by call depth, not accumulated with step count": when a subtree returns, it **releases internal io and keeps the structure** (default expose=io) — the parent sees the subtree's structural skeleton + key output, but does not carry every internal step's io. Structure is cheap and doesn't blow up, io is released on completion, so the size is determined by the depth of the current path.

---

## 6. Case: Step-by-Step Walkthrough of Multi-Level Calls

### How the call tree is generated (default rules)

The "call tree" in L1 history is **generated automatically by the framework from the call stack / DAG, with zero LLM involvement** — it is simply the program-execution fact (the paper's "context built from the execution **call tree**").

**The default expansion criterion = "will this called thing call the LLM again":**

| The called thing | Will it call the LLM | Default |
|---|---|---|
| agentic function (`Agent` method) | yes | **enters the tree**, shown as `function(input) → output`, and **recurses** the same criterion on its internals |
| plain function / tool (read/bash/arxiv_search…) | no (just does the work) | **collapsed**, not in the tree |
| the in-function LLM inference itself | — | **not in the tree** (what's past is past; the useful output has already become that function's output) |

The criterion in essence: **will call the LLM again = has context value → record it; doesn't call the LLM = pure execution operation → don't record it.** The LLM is one link in the nesting: among the things it calls, **only those that are "also agentic functions (that will call the LLM again)" continue to be added to the tree and recursed**; the plain tools it calls are all ignored (otherwise one model call invoking dozens of tools would blow up the tree).

**Nodes carry io and release it on completion**: nodes that enter the tree **carry their actual io** (input + output / model output) — the tree itself is the complete context. After a child node **finishes it releases its io, keeping only the call logic + key output** (that line `func(...) → ✓result`). The release happens in the later part of the tree (the block that just completed), leaving the old prefix untouched → append-grows + tail release, stable prefix → large segments hit the cache. The whole tree's size is determined by the **depth of the current active path**, not accumulated by the total number of calls (the paper's "by call depth not accumulation").

> This is exactly the default `expose=io`: agentic functions expose io, internal llm/plain tools collapse, completed child nodes release io. It can be overridden by expose/render_range (see §5), but **this is the default**.

#### Example structure

The whole tree (YAML; nodes = agentic functions, plain tools/model inference collapsed):

```yaml
- function: research_agent
  children:
    - function: _pick_stage          # 1 internal model decision (collapsed)
      output: "go to literature"
    - function: literature           # internal: model + seed_surveys/arxiv etc. (plain tools collapsed)
      output: "framework{4 branches}"
      children:                       # internal agentic functions (will call the LLM) → recurse into the tree
        - function: _lit_decide
        - function: seed_surveys
        - function: extract_framework
    - function: _pick_stage
      output: "go to idea"
    - function: idea
      children:
        - function: generate_ideas
          children:
            - function: check_novelty  # another agentic function inside idea → recurse
```

The `_lit_decide`/`seed_surveys`/`extract_framework` inside `literature`: only agentic functions that will call the LLM enter the tree (as in this example); plain tools are collapsed. The step walkthrough below expands them, demonstrating recursion + io release.

Below, a few call points are walked through. **The explanation labels each segment with L0/L1/L2, but the prompt examples show the continuous text the model actually receives — with no "L1/L2" wording at all** (the layering is our cache/organization view, not part of the prompt).

> Each step below blocks with **paired XML tags** (`<environment>` / `<project>` / `<call_tree>` / `<situation>`) — boundaries are explicit, and the `#`/YAML/code in the content won't be confused with the block delimiters. Inside `<call_tree>` is that L1 YAML call tree, growing as execution advances. `status: running` marks the node currently running.

#### Step ① running `_lit_decide` (tree grows to level 3)

The complete context the model actually receives (continuous text, layer labels are explanatory only). **Step ① shows all components**; subsequent steps show only the changed parts (L0 unchanged, omitted).

Call path: research_agent → _pick_stage → literature → _lit_decide
Position: literature decision point, candidates [seed_surveys / extract_framework / done]

```

What it shows: Step ① displays **all components of the complete L0+L1+L2**. The call tree has now grown to level 3, and `_lit_decide` is the current `[running]` node. The tree is assembled automatically by the framework from the call stack; the situation's call path is exactly the path from the root to `[you are here]`. In subsequent steps, **L0 is completely unchanged** (cache hit), and only the differences in L1 (call tree growth) and L2 (situation change) are shown.

#### Step ② drilling down, running `seed_surveys` (tree level 4)

**L0 same as step ① (completely unchanged, cache hit).** Showing only L1 (call tree growth) and L2 (situation change):

```text

<call_tree>                                                      ← L1 call tree (grew one level)
- function: research_agent
  children:
    - function: _pick_stage
      output: "go to literature"
    - function: literature
      status: running
      children:
        - function: _lit_decide
          output: "next step seed_surveys"        # output emitted, parent still running
        - function: seed_surveys
          status: running                      # ← you are here
          input: "query: LLM agent frameworks surveys …"
</call_tree>


<situation>                                                      ← L2 situation
You are running INSIDE `seed_surveys`.
Job: Generate seed survey queries for literature discovery.
Call path: research_agent → _pick_stage → literature → _lit_decide → seed_surveys
Position: literature retrieval step, producing the survey list
Your output is stored by literature, fed to extract_framework next.
⚠ `seed_surveys` is the function you are INSIDE — do NOT call it.
</situation>

Search query: LLM agent frameworks surveys …                     ← L2 current input

[timestamp: 2026-06-24T14:33:02Z]                                ← L2 timestamp
```

What it shows: `_lit_decide` emitted its output (`→ "next step seed_surveys"`) and so **collapses, no longer expanded**; the tree grows one level down to `seed_surveys`. **Note that `seed_surveys` internally calls plain tools like `arxiv_search` — they don't call the LLM, so per the default criterion they collapse and don't enter the tree** (otherwise one retrieval invoking dozens of tools would blow up the tree). L0 is unchanged to the letter, cache hit.

#### Step ③ bouncing back to the main loop, running the 2nd round of `_pick_stage` (literature subtree io released)

**L0 same as step ①.** The L1 call tree changes significantly (literature completes, io released), and L2 situation updates:

```text

<call_tree>                                                      ← L1 call tree (literature complete, io released)
- function: research_agent
  children:
    - function: _pick_stage
      output: "go to literature"
    - function: literature
      output: "framework{name, 4 branches}"    # key output kept (summary)
      children:                                 # structure all kept, each child node's io already released
        - {function: _lit_decide, status: done}
        - {function: seed_surveys, status: done}
        - {function: extract_framework, status: done}
    - function: _pick_stage
      status: running                           # ← you are here, main loop round 2
</call_tree>


<situation>                                                      ← L2 situation
You are running INSIDE `_pick_stage`.
Job: Select the next research stage based on completed stages.
Call path: research_agent → _pick_stage
Position: main loop round 2, [literature] done, next candidate idea
Your output will be parsed into a stage name.
⚠ `_pick_stage` is the function you are INSIDE — do NOT call it.
</situation>

Progress: literature done (framework ready). Pick the next stage. ← L2 current input

[timestamp: 2026-06-24T14:45:30Z]                                ← L2 timestamp
```

What it shows (level two: **structure kept, io released**): after literature finishes, **the call-structure lines of its internal `_lit_decide` / `seed_surveys` / `extract_framework` are still there** (the model can still see which steps produced literature), but each child node's **actual io content is released** (replaced by `→ ✓`). Structure is cheap so it's kept as a safety net, io is expensive so it's deleted. literature's own output (framework) is kept as the key output. The situation structure of round-2 `_pick_stage` is the same as round 1 → cache-friendly.

#### Step ④ deep into round 2, running `check_novelty` (recursion: another agentic function inside idea)

**L0 same as step ①.** The call tree keeps growing, nesting to level 5:

```text

<call_tree>                                                      ← L1 call tree (nested to level 5)
- function: research_agent
  children:
    - function: _pick_stage
      output: "go to literature"
    - function: literature                       # completed: structure present, io released
      output: "framework{…}"
      children:
        - {function: _lit_decide, status: done}
        - {function: seed_surveys, status: done}
        - {function: extract_framework, status: done}
    - function: _pick_stage
      output: "go to idea"
    - function: idea
      status: running
      children:
        - function: generate_ideas
          status: running
          children:
            - function: check_novelty            # ← you are here (agentic function nested inside idea, recursion)
              status: running
</call_tree>


<situation>                                                      ← L2 situation
You are running INSIDE `check_novelty`.
Job: Check whether the proposed idea is novel against existing literature.
Call path: research_agent → _pick_stage → idea → generate_ideas → check_novelty
Position: novelty-check step of the idea stage
Your output is passed to generate_ideas as the per-idea novelty verdict.
⚠ `check_novelty` is the function you are INSIDE — do NOT call it.
</situation>

[per-turn memory: abstract snippets of 3 relevant papers retrieved]  ← L2 memory prefetch

Check novelty for the following idea: <output of generate_ideas>  ← L2 current input

[output schema: {"type": "object", "properties":                 ← L2 output format
  {"novel": {"type": "boolean"}, "reason": {"type": "string"}}}]

[timestamp: 2026-06-24T15:12:45Z]                                ← L2 timestamp
```

What it shows: `generate_ideas` / `check_novelty` are **agentic functions inside idea that will call the LLM**, so per the criterion they are **recursively expanded into the tree** (had they been plain tools they'd be collapsed). The completed literature subtree **still has its structure (a few lines), with io released** — it is history's safety net, not deleted entirely. The whole session context = L0 (constant) + L1 (call tree: structure append-grows, completed nodes release io) + L2 (this call). Structure is cheap so it's all kept, io is expensive so it's released on completion → the size is determined by the **depth of the current active path**, not exploding with the total number of calls.

## 7. Situation Injection

Whenever an `Agent` method internally calls `runtime.exec`, the framework automatically injects a `<situation>` block telling the model its current execution situation.

### What the `<situation>` block contains

| Field | Source | Description |
|---|---|---|
| function name | `frame_node.name` | `You are running INSIDE the agentic function {fn_name}.` |
| Job | `frame_node.metadata["doc"]` (the function's docstring) | the function's responsibility, e.g. `Job: pick the next literature-stage action.` |
| Call path | built by `render_context` along the `called_by` chain | the call path from root to current, e.g. `research_agent → _pick_stage → literature → _lit_decide` |
| Position | passed by the caller (optional) | the position in the program, e.g. `literature decision point` |
| Your output | `output_contract` (optional) | the output's purpose, e.g. `will be parsed into a decision` |
| recursion-prevention warning | fixed text | `do NOT call {fn_name} itself (re-entering causes infinite recursion)` |

### When it is injected

In `_call_via_providers` in `runtime.py`, when building the current turn's user message, the `<situation>` block is inserted as the first text block, before the user input.

### Code locations

- `_situational_prefix(fn_name, fn_doc, call_path, position, output_contract)` — generates the `<situation>` text (`runtime.py:330-355`)
- `render_context(graph, frame_node_id)` — builds the call path along the `called_by` chain (`context/nodes.py`)
- injection point — `runtime.py:635-648`, reads info from the frame node and calls `_situational_prefix`

## 8. What the Memory Block Says About Itself

A component the model cannot name is a component the model cannot reason about. Memory is the one where that costs something: asked what it remembers, an agent that finds no answer in its context goes looking on the filesystem, and the first thing that looks like a memory system is whatever other harness happens to be installed on the same machine.

### Two blocks, two opening sentences

Memory reaches the model twice, and the two carry different jobs.

The per-turn recall block is prefixed to the user message (§4 L2, item 2). It opens with the `<memory-context>` fence and the note that this is recalled memory rather than new user input. That sentence exists to stop old facts from reading as a fresh request, and it does that job.

The resident block (`memory_global`, L0 order 50) opens with `<memory>` and a note of its own: which subsystem wrote it, where that subsystem keeps its workspace, that the block is a summary rendered under a token budget rather than everything memory holds, and which tools reach the rest. It is produced by `fence_core`, a sibling of `fence_memory` sharing `sanitize_context`.

A marker is a different opening sentence, never an extra layer. `fence_memory` is not idempotent: `sanitize_context` strips the whole `<memory-context>…</memory-context>` block, body included, so wrapping an already-fenced string returns a fence with nothing in it.

### The model is told twice, in two currencies

The tool catalog carries the cheap half. The six `memory_*` tools are in `DEFAULT_TOOLS` and all six are in `DEFERRED_DEFAULT_TOOLS`, so the catalog ships their names and the schemas stay off the wire — six names cost 20 tokens a turn, against 670 for the schemas. A name in the tool list is a harder signal than a sentence of prose, because the model trusts its tool list.

The prose carries what a tool name cannot: where memory lives on disk, that the resident block is a summary rather than the whole store, and that a background writer rather than the user produced it. That sentence costs 65 tokens and sits in the L0 cached prefix, so it is charged once per session rather than once per turn.

### Off, empty, and unavailable are three different blocks

`_build_memory` distinguishes the three states it can be in.

- The backend is switched off (`memory.backend = "none"`): nothing is emitted. That state is the user's decision and needs no narration.
- The workspace is empty: one line saying memory is on, holds nothing yet, fills in on its own, and that nothing is wrong.
- The provider raised: one line saying memory did not load this turn, and that the absence is not evidence about what the user has said.

Collapsing all three into an absent block is what lets a model read a system fault as "the user never told me this." In the latter two states the status line replaces the resident block, so those turns cost less than a healthy one, not more.

### Which of the things in front of the model belong to the harness

`<environment>` names the harness and the directory the harness keeps its own state in, alongside the OS and shell it already reports. The resident memory opener names the memory workspace by absolute path. Together they answer the question the agent got wrong: the state under `~/.openprogram` belongs to the framework running the agent, not to the project the agent is editing, and neither belongs to whatever other tooling shares the machine.

The memory writer already draws this line on its own side — it runs the Claude Code SDK with `setting_sources=[]`, so the host's `CLAUDE.md` never reaches the agent that writes memory. The context layer draws the same line for the agent that reads it.

## Appendix: Implementation Status

- `ContextComponent`, the three registries, and the assembler live in `context/components.py`, with 15 components registered. A real assembly on a default agent emits 11 of them (the other 4 are conditional and off) totalling ~1,638 tokens, of which the memory block is ~821.
- Conversation and function calls both go through `render_context` (`context/nodes.py`) and the `render_dag_messages` rendering pipeline. In the conversation scenario `frame_entry_seq=None` (top level, fully visible); in the function-call scenario the visible range is controlled by `callers`/`subcalls`/`expose`.
- The L2 situation (`_situational_prefix` + `_compute_call_path`) runs at step 6a/6b.
- Computer-use guidance and the token budget hint are not registered.
- §8 is designed, not yet built. Today `memory_global` wraps `core.md` with `fence_memory`, so the resident block carries the recall fence and its recall sentence; `fence_core` does not exist yet. `_build_memory` returns the empty string for all three of off / empty / unavailable. None of the six `memory_*` tools are in `DEFAULT_TOOLS`; they reach a session only through `toolset="memory"` or `toolset="full"`. `<environment>` reports OS and shell only. The four changes, their landing points, and their measured token cost are laid out in [`memory-introspection.html`](memory-introspection.html).
