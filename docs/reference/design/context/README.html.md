# Reading guide

Context engine — how the working context is assembled, committed, merged, and aged across turns.

- [`overview.md`](overview.md) — the context layer: pipeline, DAG storage, ContextCommit, compaction/rendering, attach/merge, cross-turn tool context
- [`compaction.md`](compaction.md) — context compaction: rolling summary node, segment-substitution rendering, HEAD integrity, DAG contract
- [`composition.md`](composition.md) — per-call layering (L0/L1/L2) and situational context
- [`comparison.md`](comparison.md) — context components compared with other frameworks
- [`compaction-diagram.html`](compaction-diagram.html) — context compaction (visualization)
- [`memory-introspection.html`](memory-introspection.html) — how an agent learns what it remembers: the marker on the memory block, the memory tools it is offered, and what it sees when memory is empty or broken (visualization)
