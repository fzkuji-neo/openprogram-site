# Function calling

How an LLM picks a function from a list, the framework runs it, and the
result feeds back as the model's next-turn input. For the moment-by-moment
loop mechanics (how the LLM picks the next tool inside one
``runtime.exec`` call), see
``docs/capabilities/agentic-programming/choosing-the-next-step/tool-calling.md``.

The governing principle is **default-on, user-curated**: a registered
tool is usable with zero configuration; the user narrows from there.
Exposure is registration-driven (a registered tool is visible unless it
opts out with `expose=False`), and a bare `runtime.exec` gets the full
exposed set. Tool-call results live only in run history and never enter
later prompt context, so broad exposure carries no context cost.

## On the wire

Same concept the industry calls "tool use" (``tools=[]`` /
``tool_calls=[]`` in the OpenAI / Anthropic / Gemini APIs). We call the
*act* "function calling" (authors write a function, expose it to the
LLM), but the *thing in the API request* stays ``tool`` to match SDK
terminology.

```
Authoring surface                     LLM API wire / providers/types.py
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
@function decorator                    Tool / ToolCall / ToolResultMessage
Agent method configuration            tools=[...] field
agent_tools() / get_agent_tool() …    tool_calls=[...] field
```

The boundary is **the wire format**: providers serialize each
``AgentTool`` in our registry into the API's ``Tool`` JSON shape; the
model's ``tool_calls`` come back, get matched by name against our
registry, and ``AgentTool.execute(...)`` runs. Our wrapping classes
(``AgentTool`` / ``AgentToolResult``) carry runtime extras the wire
format doesn't have (sidecar gating, sync→async, char-cap, etc.).

## Explicit registration and one registry

Agent methods request tool registration with `method_options["method"]["tool"] = True`. Managed Program packages explicitly list public entries in `PROGRAM_ENTRIES`. Deterministic `function()` tools and ordinary Agent methods use the same registry.

All forms use the existing AgentTool registry and authorization rules. Automatic scope capture alone does not expose a tool. The [unified Agent and Context contract](../integrations/nooa.html#contract) owns class authoring and execution lifetime.

## The gating layers

Tool selection per turn passes through these filters (skeleton from
Claude Code's `tools.ts`). Layer 2 is registration-driven exposure
(matching Claude Code / Hermes).

                                                          to load schema first
```

Default behaviour, end to end: a registered tool is **on** (Layer 2
exposed) unless its author set `expose=False`; a bare `runtime.exec`
gets the **full exposed set**. The framework does not restrict per call —
narrowing is the **caller's** choice: an agent profile (Layer 3),
per-call allow/deny, the Functions-page off-toggle (Layer 5), or
`toolset="none"` when a specific call wants no tools at all. The default
is always "give tools"; a caller that knows it needs none opts out.

Layers 1–5 mean "the LLM cannot see/use this tool". Layer 6 means "the
LLM sees the name in a catalog but must opt-in to load the schema" — the
only layer that lets the LLM itself choose what to pull in (used to keep
large MCP/plugin tool sets out of the prompt until needed).

## Per-layer default policy

The guiding principle is **default-on, user-curated**: a freshly
registered tool is usable with zero configuration; every layer's
default is "don't restrict". Layers split into two kinds —

- **Active (selection) layers** decide *what to use*. Default =
  "everything exposed". The user/caller opts IN to a narrower set.
  These are the normal path.
- **Passive (veto) layers** decide *what must not be used*. Default =
  "veto nothing". They only ever subtract, as a safety/maintenance
  backstop, and stay dormant unless a condition fires.

```
Layer  Kind      Default (no config)                Who overrides & when
──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
1      —         tool registers (available_if       author: only to gate a
       gate      absent/True)                        tool behind a feature/env
                                                     that makes it meaningless
                                                     otherwise

2      active    EXPOSED. Registered ⇒ visible to    author: expose=False for
       (expose)  the LLM, including plugin/MCP.      an internal helper the LLM
                 Bare runtime.exec ⇒ full exposed    must never see. That's the
                 set. Nothing hidden by default.     ONLY reason to touch L2.

2b     active    no preset forced. Caller gets the   caller/user: pass
       (preset)  full exposed set unless it names    toolset="research" / a
                 a subset.                           Functions-page folder to
                                                     work with fewer tools, or
                                                     toolset="none" when this
                                                     call wants no tools.

3      passive   no channel/mode restriction.        framework: a tool's
       (channel) source=None ⇒ nothing filtered.    unsafe_in fires only on
                                                     that channel (telegram/
                                                     wechat/plan). profile
                                                     toolset narrows a session.

4      passive   tool assumed runnable. Only         framework: drops a tool
       (avail)   checked when                        whose key/env/can_use is
                 only_available=True (dispatcher     missing — so the LLM never
                 path).                              sees a tool that would
                                                     error on call.

5      passive   veto nothing. allow=None,           user: Functions-page
       (veto)    deny=None, no disabled, attended    off-toggle (persistent,
                 unless set.                         tools.disabled). system:
                                                     attended-mode denies
                                                     ask_user_question;
                                                     subagent/role caps via
                                                     allow/deny. Pure subtraction.

6      active*   not deferred. Schema ships in the   author / MCP wiring:
       (defer)   request by default.                 defer=True for large MCP
                                                     surfaces → name in catalog,
                                                     LLM tool_search to load.
                                                     *active by the LLM, not the
                                                     user.
```

**L2b (active) vs L5 (passive) — why both exist, why not merged.** They
look like "user touches tools" twice but are opposite operations: L2b is
the user/caller *choosing a set to use* (additive, a folder = "today's
toolbox"); L5 is *blacklisting / capping* (subtractive, "this tool is
broken / this session may not use it"). A veto must be independent of
selection — e.g. attended-mode must withhold `ask_user_question` no
matter which folder is active; you can't rely on the user remembering to
leave it out of every folder. So the **Programs page surfaces L2b as
the primary action (organize & pick folders) and L5 as the exception
(a per-tool off switch)**; the system's own L5 vetoes (attended,
subagent caps) are code-only and invisible to the user.

## Plugins and MCP servers

Because exposure is registration-driven (Layer 2), a plugin or MCP
server makes its tools available **just by registering them** — same as
Claude Code and Hermes. There is no second step of editing a central
allowlist. Concretely:

- A plugin's tools register through the same `_build_and_register_tool`
  path as built-ins (a plugin calls `@function` / registers an
  `AgentTool`), so they land in `_registry` and are exposed by default.
- MCP-server tools are registered as `AgentTool` entries on connect and
  marked `defer=True` (Layer 6) by default, so their names appear in the
  deferred catalog and the LLM loads schemas on demand via
  `tool_search` — this keeps a large MCP surface out of every prompt
  without making the tools invisible.
- A plugin/MCP tool that should stay internal can still set
  `expose=False`; a user can still turn any of them off on the Functions
  page (Layer 5). The default, though, is "registered = usable".

## Tool profiles (Programs page)

A **tool profile** is a named configuration that says "which tools are
enabled for this conversation". The Programs page (`/programs`)
manages profiles; the chat composer lets the user pick which profile to
use.

### Concepts

```
tool catalog          all registered, exposed tools — a flat read-only
(the shelf)           list on the Programs page. Shows every tool with
                      its name + description. The catalog itself has no
                      enable/disable controls; it just shows what exists.

tool profile          a named set of tools to use — like a shopping cart
(the cart)            built from the catalog. Each profile starts with
                      ALL tools (default-on); the user removes what they
                      don't want for this scenario.

                      Operations on a profile:
                        • remove a tool (take it out of this config)
                        • add a tool (put it back — pick from "not yet
                          in this profile" list)
                        • rename / delete the profile

default profile       the built-in "all tools on" profile. Always
                      exists, cannot be deleted, contains every exposed
                      tool. Used when no other profile is selected.
```

### User flow

1. **Programs page** shows the catalog (all tools) and a sidebar of
   profiles. Clicking a profile shows which tools it includes; the
   user adds/removes tools from that profile.
2. **Chat composer** has a profile picker (e.g. a dropdown next to the
   model selector). Selecting a profile = this conversation uses that
   tool set. Default = "all tools".
3. A profile name resolves wherever ``toolset=`` is accepted (Layer
   2b). ``agent_tools(toolset="research")`` returns the tools in the
   "research" profile. Agent profiles (``agent.json``) can reference
   a tool profile by name in their ``tools.toolset`` field.

### Storage

Profiles are persisted in ``functions_meta.json`` (same location as
``programs_meta.json``), shape:

```json
{
  "profiles": {
    "default": ["bash", "read", "write", ...],   // immutable = all exposed
    "research": ["web_search", "web_fetch", "read", "write", "bash"],
    "safe": ["read", "glob", "grep", "web_search"]
  },
  "active": "default"   // which profile the chat composer is using
}
```

Creating a new profile = copy of "default" (all tools). The user then
removes tools they don't need for that scenario.

### Relationship to Layer 5 (global disable)

A profile says "this conversation uses these tools" (L2b, active
selection). The per-tool global disable (L5, ``tools.disabled``)
remains as a separate, rarely-used backstop: if a tool is globally
disabled it is removed from EVERY profile automatically (the
resolution pipeline applies L5 after L2b). But the primary user
action is profile management, not per-tool global toggles.

## Four knobs none of the reference frameworks have

Beyond the 6-layer cascade, the framework adds four runtime knobs
neither Claude Code, Hermes, nor OpenClaw ship:

```
1. Dynamic per-call result ceiling          _effective_max_chars() +
   min(per-tool max, 0.3 × ctx_window)      _current_context_window_chars
   small-context models auto-shrink         ContextVar installed by
                                            dispatcher per turn

2. LLM-controllable timeout (clamp)         If fn declares `timeout`
   LLM-passed value clamped into            param AND decorator sets
   [timeout_min, timeout_max]; both used    timeout_min/max → clamped
   as wait_for budget and fn param           and passed both places

3. Streaming tail accumulator (bounded)     _TailAccumulator —
   long-running tools writing through        capacity defaults to
   on_update can't grow unbounded            max_result_chars, head
                                            evicted on overflow

4. can_use() session-level gate              Distinct from check_fn
   process-level "can it run" (check_fn) +  (always-on installable)
   channel-level "is it allowed here"        and unsafe_in (channel
   (unsafe_in) + session-level "is this      blacklist)
   user / role allowed to use it" (can_use)
```

## Agent method registration

Agent defines ordinary methods. `method_options` assigns configuration by method name. `tool=True` explicitly registers a method, while ordinary helpers retain call scopes without tool exposure.

```python
from openprogram import Agent

class ResearchAgent(Agent):
    method_options = {
        "research": {
            "tool": True,
            "name": "research",
            "toolset": ["research"],
            "expose": "io",
        },
    }

    def research(self, topic: str, runtime=None) -> str:
        """Research a topic."""
        return self(topic)

researcher = ResearchAgent()
PROGRAM_ENTRIES = [researcher.research]
```

The Agent class installs method call handling. This handling runs cancellation hooks, runtime injection, Context derivation, DAG entry and terminal updates, and error restoration. Method options retain schema, caching, timeout, availability, approval, and explicit-step recovery settings.

Agent construction registers methods that explicitly request tool exposure. Registration uses the same existing AgentTool registry and sidecars as deterministic tools. `available_if` gates registration without removing ordinary method scopes.

The managed loader records package ownership and lists public entries in `PROGRAM_ENTRIES`. It does not add a public decorator or expand authority. The [Agent and Context contract](../integrations/nooa.html#contract) owns execution lifetime.

## Resolution path (dispatcher → provider)

```
1. user message arrives → dispatcher.process_user_turn

2. dispatcher seeds _loaded_deferred ContextVar (Layer 6) for this
   session — starts as empty set

3. dispatcher._resolve_tools(agent_profile, …) → list[AgentTool]
   → agent_tools(toolset=…, source=req.source, only_available=True)
     → walks Layers 2/3/4/5 (filter_for + sidecar gating)
     → does NOT walk Layer 6 (defer is handled later, per provider
       call)

4. dispatcher computes deferred catalog text from the *initial* set
   → injects "deferred tools available via ToolSearch:" block into
     system prompt
   → NOTE: the tools list passed to agent_loop is still the full
     list including deferred tools — agent_loop does the per-call
     split before each provider request

5. agent_loop runs the inner tool-call loop. Each provider call:
   → split_tools_for_dispatch(context.tools) → (provider_tools, _)
     - non-deferred + deferred-already-loaded → provider_tools
     - deferred-not-loaded → omitted from provider_tools
   → provider receives provider_tools as its `tools=[]` field

6. when LLM emits ToolCall(name="bash"), agent_loop:
   → looks up AgentTool by name from context.tools
     (or via _registry if not found in current list)
   → validates arguments against the schema
   → await agent_tool.execute(call_id, args, cancel, on_update)

7. if the LLM called tool_search(select="cron"):
   → tool_search.execute mutates _loaded_deferred (adds "cron")
   → next iteration of step 5 includes cron in provider_tools
     → cron's full schema is now in the next request
   → LLM can call cron normally
```

## Test invariants (what the suite locks down)

The unit suite (``tests/unit/programs/runtime/test_tools_runtime.py``,
``tests/component/agent/turns/test_dispatcher_tools.py``) covers:

- Docstring + signature → parameters schema
- Sync / async fn dispatch
- Exception → AgentToolResult(is_error=True) wrap
- Char-cap truncation + persist_full
- on_update callback delivery + tail accumulator
- cancel event propagation
- timeout (asyncio.wait_for)
- requires_approval evaluation
- Registry filter (toolset, source, names)
- All shipped @function tools register at package import
- @function with overrides (name / description / toolset)
- Layer 1 (available_if) skips registration on False / exception
- Layer 6 defer sidecar + tool_search promotes to provider list +
  unknown name handling + catalog text format
- Agent method registers as AgentTool only with explicit tool=True or as_tool=True
- method_options["method"]["tool"] = False skips shared registry
- method_options["method"]["register_globally"] = False skips shared registry
  but still attaches `_agent_tool`
- method_options["method"]["available_if"] returning False skips tool registration but retains scope handling

## Stable boundary

The registry/method/dispatcher boundary is stable. Work that
**doesn't** touch it:

- Adding new @function tools (write the function + decorate; it is
  exposed by default — no whitelist edit)
- Adding Agent methods with explicit tool=True metadata
- Hiding an internal helper from the LLM (`expose=False` kwarg only)
- Defining a named subset (TOOLSETS dict) or letting the user define one
  (Functions-page folder → functions_meta.json)
- Flagging tools defer / available_if (kwarg only)
- Wiring MCP servers / plugins — they register AgentTool entries the
  normal way and are exposed on registration (mark `defer=True` for
  large MCP surfaces)

Future work that **would** require touching the boundary (defer unless
necessary):

- Adding a new gating layer beyond the ones above
- Changing AgentTool.execute signature
- Splitting / merging the shared registry
- Replacing the deferred-loading mechanism with something other than
  ToolSearch

## Appendix — implementation status

The registry, the six gating layers, the two decorators, and the four
runtime knobs are all in place. Two user-facing entry points described
under "Tool profiles (Programs page)" and "User-editable entry points"
are not built yet:

- the Functions-page profile manager (create / edit / delete tool
  profiles, persisted to `functions_meta.json`);
- the chat-composer profile picker (choose which profile a conversation
  uses).

Until those ship, profile selection is reachable only through the
`toolset=` argument and the agent profile's `tools.toolset` field.
